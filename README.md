# Parallel-Programming-Course
This repository contains the class works and the final homework of the master's degree parallel programming course.

## Final Homework
The task consisted to solve a knight's tour problem in parallel using MPI and OpenMP, and then compare results with a secuential implementation.
The result solution was based on the work "Optimal algorithms for constructing knight’s tours on arbitrary n×m chessboards" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2004.11.002)
